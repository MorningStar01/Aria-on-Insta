Do it with passion or not at all.
She believed she could, so she did.
The past does not equal the future. 
Good things happen to those who hustle. 
At the end of hardship comes happiness.

If it matters to you, you’ll find a way. 
Forget about style; worry about results. 
Whatever you do, do with all your might. 
Dream without fear. Love without limits.
Every noble work is at first impossible. 
If you're going through hell, keep going. 
You can do anything you set your mind to.

The true success is the person who invented himself. 
Let him that would move the world first move himself.

If you feel like giving up, look back at how far you've come.
Every day may not be good but there is something good in every day.
Don’t go through life, grow through life. 
A problem is a chance for you to do your best. 
You are amazing. As you are. Stronger than you know.More beautiful than you think.
Everything is going to be okay in the end. If it's not the okay, it's not the end.

Breathe.
Slow down.
Let it be.
Go for it.
I love you.
Keep going.
